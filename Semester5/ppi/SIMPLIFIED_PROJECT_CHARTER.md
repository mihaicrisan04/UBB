# Simplified AI Banking Assistant - Project Charter

## Problem & Solution Statement

Banking customers and support agents waste valuable time navigating fragmented systems to find specific information like account limits, fee schedules, dispute procedures, and downloadable forms (KYC documents, loan applications). Our **AI Banking Assistant** provides a conversational interface powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) that delivers accurate, cited answers, direct deep links to banking portals, and inline document previews with secure downloads‚Äîall through a dynamic, ChatGPT-like UI that adapts to different industries by simply updating the knowledge base.

## Innovation Hypothesis

**We hypothesize that a single AI agent with domain-specific RAG and structured output rendering will achieve higher customer satisfaction and faster task completion rates than traditional banking search or static FAQs by delivering dynamic UI components (answers, links, document previews, tutorials) in a conversational format.**

## Minimum Viable Feature Set

### Core Features (Must-Have)
1. **RAG-Powered Q&A** - Accurate banking policy answers with source citations
2. **Deep Link Navigation** - Direct links to specific banking portal pages (card settings, dispute forms, rate schedules)
3. **Document Preview & Download** - Inline preview of forms/documents with secure download capabilities
4. **Dynamic UI Components** - Structured responses that render as different UI blocks based on query type
5. **Website Crawling** - Ability to ingest new content from provided URLs using Firecrawl

### Example Use Cases (Banking Theme)
- *"What's my daily ATM withdrawal limit?"* ‚Üí Answer + link to card settings
- *"I need to file a dispute"* ‚Üí Tutorial + dispute form preview + download link  
- *"Show me current exchange rates"* ‚Üí Live rates + link to FX portal
- *"I need KYC documents"* ‚Üí Form preview + download + completion tutorial
