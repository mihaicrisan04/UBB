do not mind the author app with the documenst and movies! that is old and is just for reffrence

the user should specify his/her name prior to using th application (login page)
after logging in the user can begin building an order by selecting products 

the selected products are added to a new order(they are saved in the database only when the user confirms the order)

discount logic:
before computing the order the totatl price is computed based on the following dynamic discount rules;
- if th order contains 3 or more products, apply 10 percent discount
- if 2 or more products share the sane category (derived from the prodcut name prefix) apply 5 percent additional discount

only when a user confirms the order the discount is computed, th order and reltead orderItem entries are saved in the databas and the final total (with discount applied) is displayed

thhe application should track the last 3 orders from this user. if the user tries to add (in the current order) a prodcut whose category already eitsts in all of the last 3 order, the system should warn the user that they are not diversifying their product choices. 

user the current app that was an author with media application to change it from that to this new store. I already started with the model and some repos. The name of the table Orderr with 2 r's is not a mistake is by choice so do not try to change it.
