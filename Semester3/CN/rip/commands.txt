RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a distance-vector routing protocol, which employs the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15.

Enabling RIP on a router:
enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
network 192.168.1.0
network 10.0.0.0
exit
write memory


show RIP routing table:
    show ip route

show RIP configuration:
    show ip protocols

Example use case:
R1, R2, R3
        NR(10.0.0.0)
      / |  \
   R1   R2  R3
    |    |    |
    N1   N2   N3

- enable RIP on all routers
- set up the directly connected networks
